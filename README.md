In this repository, you will find Chisel code for my design of a floating-point adder as described in my Bachelor's thesis. All the building blocks of the adder are contained within the file `src/main/Basic FPA.scala`, and the testing file is named `src/test/Basic FPA test.scala`. To run the code, please follow the instructions provided in the [Chisel template](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel-template).

Verilog code generated from the Chisel implementation of FPA is found under `BasicAdder.v`
